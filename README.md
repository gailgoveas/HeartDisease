## Heart Disease Classification

### Description
This project aims to perform heart disease classification using a Random Forest classifier. It includes data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation. The dataset contains various features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and diagnostic measurements. By training a Random Forest classifier on this dataset, we can predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

### Features
1. *Data preprocessing*: The project includes steps to handle categorical data by converting them into numeric values using one-hot encoding. It also handles missing data by using descriptive statistics to replace NaN values.

2. *Random Forest classifier*: The project trains a Random Forest classifier to classify heart disease based on the provided features.

3. *Model evaluation*: The project calculates the confusion matrix, accuracy, and generates a classification report to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
